# Investigate and Impplemntation of KNN Classifier for sequence prediction

## Implementation

Machine leaning Classifier (KNN Classifier) is implemeneted and integrated with the Neocortex API. The dataset is created based 
on Predicted cells of the squences of numbers; Even, odd and decimal number generated from Multisquenceleaningexpeirment from the
Neocortex API and preassigned labels 0 as even, 1, as odd, 2 as Neither odd nor even. The dataset has been split in training and
testing data. Once the model learn from the training dataset it classified the testing dataset to predict the label. 


**For Example:**

Three sequences of numbers (Even, Odd, and Neither Odd nor Even) predicted cells are generated by the Neocortex API to create a 
dataset for training the model. `LearnDatafromthefile(Datasetfilepath)` Method is to learn data from the dataset file. The dataset
has been split in 70-30 ratio using method `SplitData(sdrData, trainRatio)`.The 70 % training data is been fed to the Classifier 
model, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data. The smaller portion (30%) is reserved for testing the model's
performance. The splitting data is saved in two-dimenstional array with variable name as `traingDataset` and `TestingDataset`. 
For evey test data in testing dataset  The KNN Classifier predict the testing data label using Method 
`Classifier(testData,trainDataset, numofclass, k)`. To find out the accuracy of the model we extract the acutal label from training
dataset and match the with predicted value of the model. For accuracy the method used is `CalculateAccuracy(predictedlabels, actualLabels)`    

_**Sample Data**_


```
training data = [
7665, 8260, 8304, 8495, 9285, 9366, 9388, 9603, 9641, 9707, 9774, 9819, 9837, 10020, 10096, 10149, 10263, 10313, 10873, 10914, 0
8360, 9729, 9769, 9826, 9860, 10039, 10064, 10169, 10338, 10408, 10461, 10609, 10669, 10689, 10792, 10889, 11235, 11339, 11435, 11672, 1
9460, 9558, 9725, 9883, 10336, 10393, 10896, 10933, 10982, 11113, 11173, 11423, 11719, 11835, 11897, 11902, 12075, 12164, 12415, 12715, 2]


```

```
testing Data = [8870, 9787, 9970, 10025, 10070, 10085, 10136, 10197, 10208, 10241, 10315, 10352, 10468, 10740, 10906, 11002, 11142, 11159, 11204, 11475, 1]
```

The Verdict: The testing Data is being predicted by the model as Class 1 which is odd number sequence SDR's. 

The Output in this case is the label class of the testing data and the model accuracy.

## Getting Started:

Go to the `Myproject` folder which is one folder above and inside where a folder names KNN is present. In kNN folder the folder name KNNImplementation is present.
From there run the `Program.cs` file to run the KNN Classifier.

```bash
dotnet run --project "..Myproject\KNN\KNNImplementation\KNNImplementation.csproj"
```

Path to the
Project: [KNNClassifier.cs](https://github.com/zakaahmadchishti/Global_Variables/blob/Muhammadharis/Myproject/KNN/KNNImplementation/KNNClassifier.cs)

## Testing

The unit tests are excuted under the `KNNUnitTest` also one folder above, run the `UnitTest.cs` for the
unittests.

Path to the Unit
