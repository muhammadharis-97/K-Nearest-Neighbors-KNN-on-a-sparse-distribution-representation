# Investigate and Implementation of KNN Classifier for sequence prediction

## Implementation

The Neocortex API is seamlessly integrated with a robust Machine Learning Classifier, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier. The dataset itself is extracted from the predicted cells generated by sequences of numbers, encompassing classifications for Even, Odd, and Decimal numbers derived from the Multisequence Learning Experiment within the Neocortex API. Each classification is preassigned a label: 0 for Even, 1 for Odd, and 2 for Neither Odd nor Even. To ensure the model learns well and can predict accurately, we split the dataset into two parts: training and testing. The training part helps the model understand patterns in the data. Once it's trained, it's ready to classify the testing data accurately. This way, we can predict the right labels of testing data. 


**For Example:**

The Neocortex API generates three sequences of numbers, categorizing them as Even, Odd, or Neither Odd nor Even, which serve as predicted cells for creating a comprehensive dataset for model training.

The process begins with the utilization of the LearnDatafromthefile(Datasetfilepath) method, which enables the model to ingest and comprehend the dataset from a specified file path. Following this, the dataset is partitioned into a 70-30 ratio using the SplitData(sdrData, trainRatio) method.

The 70% of the data is allocated for training the Classifier model, allowing it to discern intricate patterns and relationships inherent in the dataset. Meanwhile, the remaining 30% is reserved for assessing the model's performance.

The split data is stored in two-dimensional arrays named trainingDataset and testingDataset, facilitating clear organization and management of the data subsets.

During the testing phase, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier employs the Classifier(testData, trainDataset, numofclass, k) method to predict the labels of the testing data.

To evaluate the model's accuracy, the predicted labels are compare with the actual labels extracted from the training dataset. This comparison is accomplished through the CalculateAccuracy(predictedLabels, actualLabels) method, which quantifies the accuracy of the model's predictions, providing valuable insights into its efficacy and performance.

```
training data = [
7665, 8260, 8304, 8495, 9285, 9366, 9388, 9603, 9641, 9707, 9774, 9819, 9837, 10020, 10096, 10149, 10263, 10313, 10873, 10914, 0
8360, 9729, 9769, 9826, 9860, 10039, 10064, 10169, 10338, 10408, 10461, 10609, 10669, 10689, 10792, 10889, 11235, 11339, 11435, 11672, 1
9460, 9558, 9725, 9883, 10336, 10393, 10896, 10933, 10982, 11113, 11173, 11423, 11719, 11835, 11897, 11902, 12075, 12164, 12415, 12715, 2]


```

```
testing Data = [8870, 9787, 9970, 10025, 10070, 10085, 10136, 10197, 10208, 10241, 10315, 10352, 10468, 10740, 10906, 11002, 11142, 11159, 11204, 11475, 1]
```

Here's the verdict: The model has predicted the testing data as Class 1, representing the odd number sequence SDR's.

The output includes the label class of the testing data and the accuracy of the model.

## Getting Started:

Navigate to the `Myproject` folder, located one level above the current directory. Inside `Myproject`, find a folder named `KNN`, and within that, you'll see another folder named `KNNImplementation`.

Once you're in the `KNNImplementation` folder, execute the `Program.cs` file to launch the KNN Classifier.

```bash
dotnet run --project "..Myproject\KNN\KNNImplementation\KNNImplementation.csproj"
