KNN CLassifier
Knn classifier is used for classification prolem, predict a class or label based on the predictor value. Simple and elgant approach for classification relative to other ML classification technique
like naive Bayes or Neural Network Classification. KNN classifier advantage is Flexibility and Simplicity.


Example:

Class: Server falling ( Low, Medium , High)
Predictor Value: (HTM reuqest handled, Physical temp)

Drawbacks:

1. unstatisfying result on Non Numeric Predictor Values
2. Not a work efficiently on Large Dataset
